<p>Hello. As many of you may be aware, I, Donald Guy, graduated from Ocean Lakes in 2008. As a result, I am busy at <a href="http://web.mit.edu">MIT</a> and no longer run Dolphinbook.</p> 
<p>
        This site is here as a demo for historical purposes only. If you would like to reincarnate it at Ocean
        Lakes or any other high school in the world, the source (and some management tools) are now available on
        <a href="http://github.com/donaldguy/dolphinbook">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p> 
        If you have any questions, feel free to contact me (ways to do that shouldn't be hard to come by). (For OLHS, 
        I might be willing to provide hosting too.)
</p>
<p>        
        The database is being reset to a clean version as of Tuesday March 23, 2010. Feel free to register,
        play with the interface and enter data. Just don't expect it to represent anything. Thanks.

<p>What is this you ask?</p>
<p>It is quite simply a place that you can do the following things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>See who's in your class.</li>
<!--	<li><span class="cs">See your friends' schedules.</span></li>
	<li><span class="cs">Other stuff (?).</span></li>
-->
	<li>(other things to be added (?))</li>
</ul>
