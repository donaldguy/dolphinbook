<p>Yes, you do have to register.. even if you did last year</p>
<p>Also, people are making many, many mistakes. They are easier to find and fix
if they are corrected. Look at the notes on the <a href="editsched.php"> Edit Schedule page</a> and act accordingly. Further, if you know some SQL and want to help, <a href="mailto:admin@olhs.donaldguy.com"> email me</a></p>

<p><b>Attention: </b>I am tired of dealing with bounced emails and cluttered databases, if you haven't done e-mail verification as of 1:25PM on Wednesday, your account has been deleted. You are free to reregister. If you gave a valid email, and never recieved a verifcation email (because of spam filters or whatever), lt me know; I can activate your account manually</p>

<p>What is this you ask?</p>
<p>It is quite simply a place that you can do the following things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>See who's in your class.</li>
<!--	<li><span class="cs">See your friends' schedules.</span></li>
	<li><span class="cs">Other stuff (?).</span></li>
-->
	<li>(other things to be added (?))</li>
</ul>
